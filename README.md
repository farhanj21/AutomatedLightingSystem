# AutomatedLightingSystem

This project is an Arduino-based motion-activated LED system that uses a PIR sensor to detect movement and an LDR sensor to measure ambient light levels. The LED brightness adjusts based on the ambient light, and a switch allows turning the system on or off.

## Features
- **Motion Detection:** Uses a PIR sensor to detect movement.
- **Automatic Brightness Control:** Uses an LDR sensor to measure ambient light and adjust LED brightness.
- **Timeout Functionality:** LED turns off after a set period (default: 5 seconds) if no motion is detected.
- **Manual Override:** A switch allows turning the system ON or OFF.

## How to Use
1. Launch the **TinkerCad** link provided in **Report.pdf**
2. Click "Start Simulation"
3. Turn the Slideswitch on
4. Click on the PIR and observe the LED On and Off procedure per levels of light
5. Observe the Serial Monitor to see changes
